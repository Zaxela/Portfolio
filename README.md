# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Alex. Welcome to my GitHub repository, which is a portfolio containing the data science work that I have done such as for Springboard's Data Science curriculum.

This portfolio contains many projects and case studies applying data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.
My biggest projects consists of two capstone projects: a time series analysis forecasting average temperature using ARIMA modeling (which you can see [here](https://github.com/Zaxela/Portfolio/tree/main/Capstone_3_Temperature_Forecasting)), and a classification analysis predicting student tutoring using classifiers such as Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting (which you can see [here](https://github.com/Zaxela/Portfolio/tree/main/Capstone_2_Student_Tutoring_Prediction)).

Thank you for your time and interest in my work.
